Phase 4: Model Development

4.1 Architecture Design

1D-CNN Layer: Implement convolutional layers to extract local features from the email text.
Leaky ReLU Activation: Introduce non-linearity using Leaky ReLU to handle negative values.
Bi-GRU Layer: Add Bidirectional GRU layers to capture context from both directions.
Pooling Layer: Apply max-pooling to reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps.
Fully Connected Layer: Aggregate features and perform classification.
Output Layer: Use a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.
Email parsing: This is used in each and every function in our module to analyze the contents inside the email
Alerts: Users will get alerts in the email after the email content analysis is finished.
File extension restriction: Uses poplib, email and os modules to blacklist certain extensions to prevent the downloads of malicious files.
SMTPS & Domain Analysis : Write a python script to SMTPS verification & domain reputation checks using libraries like WHOIS, dns resolver, ssl, etc.
Certificate Validation and Verification: Verify certificates against trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs), check expiration dates, validate domain names, and verify revocation status using CRLs or OCSP
DNS Blacklisting : Use an in house Blacklist for domain names and source IP addresses to identify malicious incoming emails from threat actors.
4.2 Model Implementation

Coding: Develop the model architecture using TensorFlow and Keras.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs to improve model performance.
4.3 Model Training

       4.5 Feature Extraction

Feature extraction involves identifying, extracting, and processing relevant information from emails that can help in detecting phishing attempts. For email authentication techniques like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, the following steps can be taken:

SPF (Sender Policy Framework) Check:
Extract SPF Record: Parse the email headers to identify the SPF record.

Verify SPF Record: Check if the email’s sending IP is authorized to send on behalf of the domain.

DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) Check:
Extract DKIM Signature: Parse the email headers to extract the DKIM signature.

Verify DKIM Signature: Validate the DKIM signature by querying the DNS for the public key and checking the signature against the email content.

DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance) Check:
Extract DMARC Record: Parse the DNS records for the domain to find the DMARC policy.

Verify DMARC Policy: Check if the email aligns with the domain’s DMARC policy, which typically involves verifying both SPF and DKIM.
